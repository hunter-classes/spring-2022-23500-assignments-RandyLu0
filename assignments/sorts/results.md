## Quicksort in place 
* Performs about the same regardless of pivot on random dataset 
* Better pivot performs best on sorted data and bad pivot performs worst

## Quicksort
* Same characteristics as quicksort in place but slower
* Like Mergesort uses a lot of memory so not suitable for arbitrarily large _n_

## Mergesort
* Performs better on sorted dataset than random
* Performance does not vary as much as both quicksorts i.e. more "consistent"
* Generally slower than both quicksorts on random dataset
