* Project 5 Stacks and Queues

* Due: Friday April 29, 7:00AM

* Folder and files

- Create a folder under assignments named *stacks_queues* 
  and place all files there.

- This project requires:
  - A Makefile
  - Doctest based tests
  - At least three targets in the Makefile
    1. main (program executable)
    2. tests (doctest tests executable)
    3. clean (remove the .o files) 

* Part 1 - Stacks

Create a linked list based stack class. You can call the class
whatever you'd like. Feel free to use code that you developed for
earlier projects (Node, etc.). 

You mist implement the following functionality:
1. Constructor/destructors
2. push(int) (you can change the type to std::string if you'd like)
3. int pop() // remove and return the top item
4. int top() // return but do not remove the top item
5. bool is_empty() // return true if empty, false otherwise

You must also use exception handling (try/catch) to handle error
situations like stack empty and full (although you really can't test
full easily so just implement it but don't worry about testing).


* Part 2 - Queues

This part will be added once we cover queues in class.
